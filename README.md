### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](\comp\qr-code-component-main\stylea.css) - For styles

### What I learned
i learnt of the use of meta tags and how the are used.i also learnt that cards are a type of user interface element used to display information and data in a structured, visually appealing manner.The divs are HTML elements used for grouping and organizing content on a web page.
They are often used to create sections of a page and apply CSS styles to them.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>above is a screenshot of a QR code</h1>
```
```css
.card {
  color: burlywood;
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```


```



Continued development

continue building websites and also further advance to PHP.
